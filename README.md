# MQTTHardwareInfo
Transmits computer sensor data gathered using OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll (acquired as part of [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/)'s download) over MQTT. 

I found this lying around on my drive, figured I'd make it available. Not sure how well it works, but it's at least a start. 
May come back to this and make some upgrades if I feel like it.
